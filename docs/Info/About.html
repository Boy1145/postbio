            <p>Since I was a child, I've been exposed to electronic devices. I was surprised by a device that didn't take up much space could collect information and news from all over the world. I wondered how such a small monitor could display so much information. From then on, I developed a strong curiosity about various electronic devices like phones and computers. This wonder has stayed with me and led me to choose Computer Engineering as my major.</p>
            
            <p>After entering PSU, this curiosity has continued to be my motivation to learn various subjects, including C++, Java, circuit knowledge, and binary logic. Whenever I faced difficult challenges, I would think about the possibilities of code – how a single piece of code could make a computer perform all sorts of actions. This would reignite my curiosity and motivate me to keep learning.</p>
            
            <p>This knowledge not only increased my interest but also boosted my sense of accomplishment. Building on this experience, I completed a project using Java to create a simple Game Reward System in a group. We used code to develop separate systems for administrators and players. When we presented our project to the professor and classmates, the sense of accomplishment was overwhelming.</p>
            
            <p>Putting this knowledge into practice, I want to use these skills in real life. I am looking for internship opportunities in Computer Engineering to apply my academic knowledge to real-world engineering challenges.
